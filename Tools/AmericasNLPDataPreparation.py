"""
Script to prepare the data from the AmericasNLP 2021 repository, with the names
of the files to prepare being read from the command line.

The command line arguments are the file path for each of the AmericasNLP files
the user wants to prepare.

The data preparation for each file removes the lines that contain urls or
copyright symbols. The remaining lines are then output to a file with the same
name as the input file (the output file overwrites the input file for each file
being prepared). The script also produces a combined dev file and combined train
file, which will have all the prepared lines from each of the dev files/each of
the train files given as command line arguments (and assumes files will have the
same name that they do in the AmericasNLP repository, for example, 'dev.cni')
